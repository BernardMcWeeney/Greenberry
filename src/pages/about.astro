            From a small idea to helping businesses across Ireland

            <p>
              Founded in {COMPANY.foundedYear}, Greenberry began with a simple mission: to make high-quality web development accessible to Irish businesses of all sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We noticed that many small businesses were struggling with outdated websites or overpaying for basic services. We set out to change that by offering affordable, fully-managed website solutions that prioritize performance, design, and results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're proud to have helped over 100 businesses across Ireland establish and grow their online presence. Our small but dedicated team brings expertise in web development, design, SEO, and digital strategy to every project.
