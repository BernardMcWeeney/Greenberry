            <p>
              Founded in {COMPANY.foundedYear}, Greenberry began with a simple mission: to make high-quality web development accessible to Irish businesses of all sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We noticed that many small businesses were struggling with outdated websites or overpaying for basic services. We set out to change that by offering affordable, fully-managed website solutions that prioritize performance, design, and results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're proud to have helped non-profits and businesses across Ireland establish and grow their online presence. Our small but dedicated team brings expertise in web development, design, SEO, and digital strategy to every project.

          If you need a website, you need excellent support. Greenberry is built around
          proactive care and plain-English guidance — the kind that solves problems fast,
          protects your budget, and keeps your site working for you day after day.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
          We’ll never sell you something you don’t need. Our job is to help you reach your
          goals with the smallest, smartest solution that does the job well. When there’s a
          better way, we’ll tell you. When it’s overkill, we’ll say so.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
          That’s why clients stay. They get responsive, human support that goes above and
          beyond — updates done, issues fixed, improvements suggested, and real progress made
          month after month.
        </p>
