    quote: "I asked Bernard to design a website for my new business in 2021. From the outset Bernard was very helpful and professional. I asked for a number of changes, none of which were a problem for him and were changed very quickly. The look and feel of the website has been complimented by a number of my clients and I was more than happy to pass on Bernard's contact details to them. Bernard has always been available when I have approached him for assistance and ongoing support. Oliver Cudden",
